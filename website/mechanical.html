			<h1>Mechanical System</h1>
			<img src="images/finalcad.png" height="400" width="700">
			<p>
				Our final mechanical system involves a body constructed of foam, acrylic, metal ballast, and carbon fiber sheet whith three actuated joints, overall designed to shed vortices in water. [[some description of the CAD which would be in place above this??]]
			</p>
			<h2>Actuation</h2>
			<p>
				A detailed description of your mechanical design (CAD images/renderings are appropriate) and any necessary analysis.<br>
				overview of different mechanisms we tried? And final pattern of motion. Video of being able to get the fish moving with the actuation, and then say that the motion based off this was built off of in code and simulation.

			<h2>Prototyping</h2>
			<p>
				A detailed description of your mechanical design (CAD images/renderings are appropriate) and any necessary analysis.<br>
				lead into next section via talking about balancing, by adding weight and foam as needed, as this was far easier than modeling.

			 <br>(this video should be sparky's tail balancing in water)
			</div>
			<h2>Body</h2>
			<p>
				A detailed description of your mechanical design (CAD images/renderings are appropriate) and any necessary analysis.<br>
				more cad? and talking about balancing, and basically the process of getting everything balanced. And the connections, waterproofing, lay-up operation, etc...
